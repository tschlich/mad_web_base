## Modular multiuser web development

At this moment there is only my idea of a better world. There are also some projects aside of this one, after cleaning them they will be grouped here.

* Base system using Docker or Vagrant
* Configurable system environments like
    * frameworks (i.e. Zend, Yii, Symfony ...)
    * software (i.e. TYPO3, Magento, Wordpress ...)
    * individual projects
